# Dining Philosophers - 42 School Project

![Dining Philosophers](dining_philosophers.png)

This project is a solution to the classic Dining Philosophers problem, implemented as part of the curriculum at 42 School. The Dining Philosophers problem is an example of a synchronization problem in computer science, where multiple processes (philosophers) compete for shared resources (forks) in a concurrent system.

The goal of this project is to develop a solution that avoids deadlock and starvation, ensuring that each philosopher can successfully eat without conflicts. The implementation should demonstrate a good understanding of concurrent programming, synchronization techniques, and handling shared resources.

## Project Features

- Simulation of the Dining Philosophers problem.
- Implementation of a solution to prevent deadlock and starvation.
- Proper resource allocation and synchronization using mutexes or semaphores.
- Visual representation of the dining philosophers scenario.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the source code files for the Dining Philosophers solution.
- `include/` - Contains header files used by the source code.
- `images/` - Contains images related to the project, such as diagrams or screenshots.
- `README.md` - This file providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE` - The project's license information.

## Getting Started
